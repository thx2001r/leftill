# LefTill
A simple way to track how much money is left until your next paycheck.

## Short-term goals:
* Configuration of recurring income, planned expenses, and unplanned spending
* Parsing of recurrences that within a date range (pay period until next pay period)
* Figuring out a current cleared balance at a point in time, akin to a "T" account in accounting terms

## Long-term goals:
* Create a configuration UI for recurrences
* Create a UI to log cleared income and planned expenses
* Create a UI to override planned income/expenses (when paycheck or bills vary per pay period)
* Create a UI to log current bank account balance
